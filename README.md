These are my works from Computer Vision laboratory in [PCZ](https://pcz.pl). Each laboratory has its own instructions, including projects. We have been asked to do only one of the projects, and I chose the first one. This repository is here for only archive purpose, I'm not considering to work on it further.

**Note:** I mainly used MATLAB R2023a version but almost everything is compatible with older versions like R2017.

> MathWorks sucks, but MATLAB is kinda cool :-)
